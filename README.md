**Quick, Quaint; Qrypt.  Welcome to Encryption Quantified.***


 **NEVER USE THIS. THIS ISN'T EVEN ENCRYPTION. I HAD WRITTEN OUT DOCUMENTATION FOR QRYPT THAT USED INJECTIVE FUNCTIONS TO REMOVE 30% OF THE INFORMATION FROM A FILE, SPLIT INTO TWO KEYFILES, ENCRYPTED WITH A PASSCODE, BUT THAT WAS NEVER EVEN MADE. IF I HAD MADE THAT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST USABLE, BUT I DIDNT. SERIOUSLY, THIS IS REALLY BAD.**
